I will be singing Seo in Guk’s “Take,” a Korean remake of A-ha’s “Take on Me.” This will include a vocalist and a instrumental track in the background. 
When one sings, air is pumped into or out of the lungs by contracting and relaxing muscles in the diaphragm. When more air is released from the lungs, the sound produced is louder. The air then reaches the vocal folds. These vocal folds are able to come apart and close very quickly, causing vibrations that produce the note wanted. When the folds vibrate faster, the note produced are higher. However when a singer tries to sing a note that the vocal folds cannot reach, it causes the folds to spasm, creating a voice crack. After the air leaves the vocal folds, the sound is shaped even more by the tongue, the mouth, and the cheeks. This allows words to be formed and sung.
